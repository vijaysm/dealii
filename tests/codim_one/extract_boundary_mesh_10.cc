// We can not copy boundary ids from edges of the volume mesh to edges
// of the surface mesh in 3d because the boundary edges of the volume
// mesh are not necessarily boundary edges of the surface mesh.
//
// if the original mesh's geometry was only defined via the boundary
// indicators, this leads to a surface mesh with a geometry
// description of edges that is not likely what was desired. there is
// little one can do about it with only boundary_ids, and without
// resorting to manifold_ids. this testcase in essence just ensures
// that we continue to get this "undesirable" behavior until someone
// comes up with a better idea
